# Naming Conventions

Because this repo contains files/generated reports in extensions such as .pdf, there will be a way to specify which language each report is written in.  

Either way, description of each project will be in README.md  

## Template:
0001-template-DA-R  
Project number 0001 - Name(template) - Type(Data Analysis) - Language (R)  

Later numbers are more recent, hence usually higher level and more challenging.  
### Example:  
0002-Faces-DA-Julia  
Project number 0002 - Faces - Data Analysis - Julia  
0003-Tweets-ML-Python  
Project number 0003 - Tweets - Machine Learning - Python  

## Types Type  
DA | Data Analysis  
DV | Data Visualization  
ML | Machine Learning  
SI | Statistical Inference
